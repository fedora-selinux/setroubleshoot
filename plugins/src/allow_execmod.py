    The $SOURCE application attempted to load $TARGET_PATH which
    requires text relocation.  This is a potential security problem.
    Most libraries do not need this permission. Libraries are
    sometimes coded incorrectly and request this permission.  The

    web page explains how to remove this requirement.  You can configure
    SELinux temporarily to allow $TARGET_PATH to use relocation as a
    workaround, until the library is fixed. Please file a
bug report.
