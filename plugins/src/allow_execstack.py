    The $SOURCE application attempted to make its stack
    executable.  This is a potential security problem.  This should
    never ever be necessary. Stack memory is not executable on most
    OSes these days and this will not change. Executable stack memory
    is one of the biggest security problems. An execstack error might
    in fact be most likely raised by malicious code. Applications are
    sometimes coded incorrectly and request this permission.  The
    <a href="http://people.redhat.com/drepper/selinux-mem.html">SELinux Memory Protection Tests</a>
    web page explains how to remove this requirement.  If $SOURCE does not
    work and you need it to work, you can configure SELinux
    temporarily to allow this access until the application is fixed. Please
file a bug report.

    Sometimes a library is accidentally marked with the execstack flag,
    if you find a library with this flag you can clear it with the
