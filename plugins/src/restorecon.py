    SELinux denied access requested by $SOURCE. $TARGET_PATH may
    be a mislabeled.  $TARGET_PATH default SELinux type is
    <B>%s</B>, but its current type is <B>$TARGET_TYPE</B>. Changing
    this file back to the default type, may fix your problem.
    <p>
    File contexts can be assigned to a file in the following ways.
    <ul>
        <li>Files created in a directory receive the file context of the parent directory by default.
        <li>The SELinux policy might override the default label inherited from the parent directory by
            specifying a process running in context A which creates a file in a directory labeled B
            will instead create the file with label C. An example of this would be the dhcp client running
            with the dhclient_t type and creating a file in the directory /etc. This file would normally
            receive the etc_t type due to parental inheritance but instead the file
            is labeled with the net_conf_t type because the SELinux policy specifies this.
        <li>Users can change the file context on a file using tools such as chcon, or restorecon.
    </ul>
    This file could have been mislabeled either by user error, or if an normally confined application
    was run under the wrong domain.
    <p>
    However, this might also indicate a bug in SELinux because the file should not have been labeled
    with this type.
    <p>
    If you believe this is a bug, please file a bug report against this package.
