    The $SOURCE application attempted to change the access protection of memory on
    the heap (e.g., allocated using malloc).  This is a potential security
    problem.  Applications should not be doing this. Applications are
    sometimes coded incorrectly and request this permission.  The
    <a href="http://people.redhat.com/drepper/selinux-mem.html">SELinux Memory Protection Tests</a>
    web page explains how to remove this requirement.  If $SOURCE does not work and
    you need it to work, you can configure SELinux temporarily to allow
    this access until the application is fixed. Please file a bug
    report against this package.
