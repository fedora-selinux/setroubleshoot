    SELinux permission checks on files labeled file_t are being
    denied.  file_t is the context the SELinux kernel gives to files
    that do not have a label. This indicates a serious labeling
    problem. No files on an SELinux box should ever be labeled file_t.
    If you have just added a disk drive to the system you can
    relabel it using the restorecon command.  For example if you saved the
home directory from a previous installation that did not use SELinux, 'restorecon -R -v /home' will fix the labels. Otherwise you should
    relabel the entire file system.
