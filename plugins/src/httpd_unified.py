    SELinux prevented httpd $ACCESS access to http files.

    Ordinarily httpd is allowed full access to all files labeled with http file
    context.  This machine has a tightened security policy with the $BOOLEAN
    turned off,  This requires explicit labeling of all files.  If a file is
    a cgi script it needs to be labeled with httpd_TYPE_script_exec_t in order
    to be executed.  If it is read only content, it needs to be labeled
    httpd_TYPE_content_t, it is writable content. it needs to be labeled
    httpd_TYPE_script_rw_t or httpd_TYPE_script_ra_t. You can use the
    chcon command to change these context.  Please refer to the man page
    "man httpd_selinux" or
    <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/docs/selinux-apache-fc3">FAQ</a>
    "TYPE" refers to one of "sys", "user" or "staff" or potentially other
    script types.
