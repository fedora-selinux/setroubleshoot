    SELinux has denied $SOURCE "$ACCESS" access to device $TARGET_PATH.
    $TARGET_PATH is mislabeled, this device has the default label of the /dev directory, which should not
    happen.  All Character and/or Block Devices should have a label.

    You can attempt to change the label of the file using

    restorecon -v '$TARGET_PATH'.

    If this device remains labeled device_t, then this is a bug in SELinux policy.

    Please file a bug report.

    If you look at the other similar devices labels, ls -lZ /dev/SIMILAR, and find a type that would work for $TARGET_PATH,
    you can use chcon -t SIMILAR_TYPE '$TARGET_PATH', If this fixes the problem, you can make this permanent by executing
    semanage fcontext -a -t SIMILAR_TYPE '$FIX_TARGET_PATH'

    If the restorecon changes the context, this indicates that the application that created the device, created it without
    using SELinux APIs.  If you can figure out which application created the device, please file a bug report against this application.
