    SELinux is preventing $SOURCE from creating a file with a context of $SOURCE_TYPE on a filesystem.
    Usually this happens when you ask the cp command to maintain the context of a file when
    copying between file systems, "cp -a" for example.  Not all file contexts should be maintained
    between the file systems.  For example, a read-only file type like iso9660_t should not be placed
    on a r/w system.  "cp -p" might be a better solution, as this will adopt the default file context
    for the destination.
