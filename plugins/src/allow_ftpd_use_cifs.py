    SELinux prevented the ftp daemon from $ACCESS files stored on a CIFS filesystem.
    CIFS (Comment Internet File System) is a network filesystem similar to

    The ftp daemon attempted to read one or more files or directories from
    a mounted filesystem of this type.  As CIFS filesystems do not support
    fine-grained SELinux labeling, all files and directories in the
    filesystem will have the same security context.

    If you have not configured the ftp daemon to read files from a CIFS filesystem
    this access attempt could signal an intrusion attempt.
