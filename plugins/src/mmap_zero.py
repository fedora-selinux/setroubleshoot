    SELinux has denied the $SOURCE the ability to mmap low area of the kernel
    address space.  The ability to mmap a low area of the address space, as
    configured by /proc/sys/kernel/mmap_min_addr.  Preventing such mappings
    helps protect against exploiting null deref bugs in the kernel. All
    applications that need this access should have already had policy written
    for them.  If a compromised application tries modify the kernel this AVC
    would be generated. This is a serious issue. Your system may very well be
