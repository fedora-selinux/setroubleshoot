    SELinux prevented the ftp daemon from $ACCESS files stored on a NFS filesystem.
    NFS (Network Filesystem) is a network filesystem commonly used on Unix / Linux
    systems.

    The ftp daemon attempted to read one or more files or directories from
    a mounted filesystem of this type.  As NFS filesystems do not support
    fine-grained SELinux labeling, all files and directories in the
    filesystem will have the same security context.

    If you have not configured the ftp daemon to read files from a NFS filesystem
    this access attempt could signal an intrusion attempt.
