    SELinux has prevented wine from performing an unsafe memory operation.

SELinux denied an operation requested by wine-preloader, a program used
to run Windows applications under Linux.  This program is known to use
an unsafe operation on system memory but so are a number of
malware/exploit programs which masquerade as wine.  If you were
attempting to run a Windows program your only choices are to allow this
operation and reduce your system security against such malware or to
refrain from running Windows applications under Linux.  If you were not
attempting to run a Windows application this indicates you are likely
being attacked by some for of malware or program trying to exploit your
system for nefarious purposes.

Please refer to

Which outlines the other problems wine encounters due to its unsafe use
of memory and solutions to those problems.
